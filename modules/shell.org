#+title: Shell Configuration

* Eshell
Eshell is configured with Plan 9 smart display emulation and integrated with
=eat= (Emulate A Terminal) for proper terminal emulation when needed. This setup
replaces =vterm= with a lighter-weight solution that stays within Eshell.

Key settings:
- Enable =em-smart= for Plan 9-style smart command display
- Clear =eshell-visual-commands= since =eat= handles curses applications
- Use =plain-echo-behavior= for proper =-n= flag support in echo
- Point =bash-completion= at Homebrew's Bash (MacOS ships an outdated version)

(use-package! eat

  :init
  (add-hook 'eshell-load-hook #'eat-eshell-mode))

(after! bash-completion
  (setq bash-completion-prog "/opt/homebrew/bin/bash"))
