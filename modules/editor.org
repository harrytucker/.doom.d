#+title: Editor Configuration

* Evil
I can use =undo-tree= as a linear system most of the time, which is what ends up
happening. In other cases, =undo-tree= basically provides a free stash of previous
code changes if I've been experimenting with some code, so is a nice escape
hatch to have, so I've enabled it as my undo system.
#+begin_src elisp
;; Allows undoing and redoing as a tree of changes, instead of being limited to
;; linear changes
(evil-set-undo-system 'undo-tree)
#+end_src

* Projects
When using =projectile=, I don't want to search some directories that are just
noise, so I want to ignore them.
#+begin_src elisp
(use-package! projectile
  :defer
  :config
  ;; When looking for Go project files, I don't care about vendored dependencies
  (add-to-list 'projectile-globally-ignored-directories "*vendor"))
#+end_src

* Completions
I'm trying out replacing =company-mode= with =corfu=. This is mainly because I've
read largely positive things about this new completion package and I'm hoping
it's a bit leaner and faster than =company-mode=.
#+begin_src elisp
(use-package! corfu
  :defer
  :config
  ;; Automatically select the first valid completion candidate
  (setq corfu-preselect 'prompt))
#+end_src
