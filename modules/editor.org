#+title: Editor Configuration

* Undo System
Use =undo-tree= as the undo system for Evil mode. This provides a visual tree of
all changes, which is useful for recovering experimental code changes that would
be lost with linear undo.
#+begin_src elisp
(evil-set-undo-system 'undo-tree)
#+end_src

* Projects
Ignore noisy directories when searching with Projectile. Go's =vendor/= directory
is particularly problematic as it contains vendored dependencies that clutter
search results.
#+begin_src elisp
(use-package! projectile
  :defer
  :config
  (add-to-list 'projectile-globally-ignored-directories "*vendor"))
#+end_src

* Completions
Use =corfu= for in-buffer completion. The =corfu-preselect= setting ensures the
first valid candidate is always pre-selected for faster confirmation.
#+begin_src elisp
(use-package! corfu
  :defer
  :config
  (setq corfu-preselect 'prompt))
#+end_src
