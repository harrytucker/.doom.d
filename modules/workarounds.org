#+title: Workarounds

* MacOS
MacOS-specific fixes:

- *UK Keyboard Hash Symbol*: The =#= character is typed with =Opt+3= on UK
  keyboards, which conflicts with Doom's workspace shortcuts. Re-bind this in
  insert mode only.
- *Man-mode*: BSD =sed= doesn't work with =Man-mode=; use GNU =gsed= from Homebrew.

(when (featurep :system 'macos)
  (map! :i "M-3" #'(lambda () (interactive) (insert "#")))
  (setq Man-sed-command "gsed"))
