#+title: Workarounds

* MacOS
MacOS has a few things that can sometimes cause issues with Doom Emacs. Here's
some configuration that only activates on MacOS installs to fix those.
#+begin_src elisp
;; MacOS only configuration
(when (featurep :system 'macos)
  ;; Mac UK keyboard layout puts the '#' symbol under Opt + 3 which
  ;; conflicts with Doom's workspace shortcuts.
  ;;
  ;; Rebind this in insert mode only so that I can still use the hash
  ;; symbol.
  (map! :i "M-3" #'(lambda () (interactive) (insert "#")))
  ;; BSD sed doesn't work with Man-mode, use the GNU variant.
  (setq Man-sed-command "gsed"))
#+end_src
